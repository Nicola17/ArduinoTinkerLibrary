====================

**Arduino Tinker Library** is aimed at fast development of Arduino projects.

#### The Library

The primary goal of the library is to provide a framework for fast and reliable development of Arduino projects. 

It cointains the following modules:

* Template algorithms
* Helper classes
* Complete and flexible logging system
* Wrapper classes for sensors
* Wrapper classes for actuators
* Geometric computation tools

#### Additional Dependencies

Some classes of the Arduino Tinker Library require additional libraries.
If you want to use those classes in your project you must download and install the corresponding external dependencies.

*	[LiquidCrystal] [1]
	* LiquidCrystalLog

*	[Adafruit_NeoPixel] [2]
	* NeoPixelCircularDisplay
	
* [Adafruit_Sensor] [3]
  * MagneticSensorLSM303 
  
* [Adafruit_LSM303DLHC] [4]
  * MagneticSensorLSM303 
	


Please follow [this guide] [5] to install external dependencies in your Arduino IDE


When you clone the library on your PC you will find in [./resources/AdditionalDependencies.zip][6] all the required libraries.
